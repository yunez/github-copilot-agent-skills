# GitHub Copilot Agent Skills

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills)](https://www.skills.sh/thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills) Only added 28/07/2026 - stats will be low until engagement follows this :)

A curated collection of reusable agent skills and GitHub Copilot Chat agents covering Azure architecture, API Management, Terraform, diagramming, GitHub Agentic Workflows, and skill authoring. Each skill encapsulates engineering guidance and structured workflows so you do not have to restate context in every chat session.

Install the full curated collection with APM, pick an individual skill through the skills CLI, or clone the repository to explore everything including work in progress.

## What are agent skills?

A **skill** is a focused instruction bundle — a `SKILL.md` file — that GitHub Copilot loads when a task matches its trigger description. Skills carry a defined purpose, step-by-step workflow, tool guidance, and references, replacing ad-hoc prompts with consistent, repeatable behaviour.

An **agent** is a selectable GitHub Copilot Chat mode with a fixed role, persona, and tool access. Agents appear in the Copilot Chat agent picker and guide you through multi-step workflows such as designing an architecture or upgrading a Terraform provider.

## Browse the skills

The repository is indexed at **[skills.sh/thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills](https://www.skills.sh/thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills)**, where you can browse individual skills, view their descriptions, and see skills.sh-specific installation statistics. Note that the skills.sh counters reflect installs made through the skills.sh platform and CLI; they do not include APM installations, Git clones, or manual copies.

For the full source, examples, scripts, history, and contribution process, this GitHub repository remains the canonical reference.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- VS Code or VS Code Insiders with [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and GitHub Copilot Chat enabled.
- For APM installs: [APM (Agent Package Manager)](https://github.com/microsoft/apm).

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex
```

---

### Option 1 — skills CLI (browse or install individual skills)

Use the skills CLI when you want to browse the catalogue or install a single skill without pulling in a full bundle.

```bash
npx skills add thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills
```

---

### Option 2 — APM (curated packages with declared dependencies)

APM installs skills, agents, and MCP server configuration together. The root package pulls in all curated bundles. Use APM when you want a reproducible, manifest-driven install.

**Install the full curated collection:**

```bash
apm install thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills
```

**Install an individual bundle:**

```bash
apm install thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills/packages/architect
apm install thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills/packages/terraform
apm install thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills/packages/diagramming
apm install thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills/packages/drawio-mcp-diagramming
```

APM deploys agents and MCP configuration to the selected target. By default, skills are placed in `.agents/skills/`. Use `--legacy-skill-paths` if you need per-client directories such as `.github/skills/`.

---

### Option 3 — Clone the repository

Clone or fork the repository to access every skill, including work in progress, and to contribute changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomast1906/github-copilot-agent-skills.git
```

Open the folder in VS Code, ensure GitHub Copilot Chat is enabled, and start the MCP servers relevant to the skills you plan to use (see [MCP servers](#mcp-servers) below). Then invoke a skill explicitly:

```
Use the waf-assessment skill to review this architecture.
```

Or select an agent from the GitHub Copilot Chat agent picker.

## MCP servers

Some skills call MCP servers for live data or diagram editing. APM configures the MCP servers bundled in package manifests automatically. Direct clones can use the included [`.vscode/mcp.json`](.vscode/mcp.json).

|---|---|---|
| Azure MCP | `architecture-design`, `waf-assessment`, `azure-pricing`, `cost-optimization`, `terraform-module-creator` | Install the [Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) VS Code extension; the server registers automatically. |

| Excalidraw MCP | `excalidraw-mcp-diagramming` | Configured automatically by `packages/diagramming` or the included `.vscode/mcp.json`. |
| Terraform MCP | `terraform-provider-upgrade`, `terraform-module-creator` | Configured automatically by `packages/terraform` or the included `.vscode/mcp.json`. Requires Docker. HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise credentials are optional for public registry use. |

## Creating or contributing a skill

Each skill lives under `.github/skills/<skill-name>/` and requires a `SKILL.md` file that contains its purpose, trigger description, step-by-step workflow, and tool guidance. Supporting references belong in a `references/` subdirectory. Reusable helpers belong in `.github/scripts/`.

To contribute a new skill or improve an existing one:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Add or update the skill directory under `.github/skills/`.
3. Run the format validation script before opening a pull request:

   ```bash
   ./.github/scripts/validate-agent-skills.sh
   ```

4. Open a pull request — the [`validate-skills`](.github/workflows/validate-skills.yaml) GitHub Actions workflow runs the same check on every push and pull request touching `.github/skills/`.

The [`skill-creator`](.github/skills/skill-creator) skill itself can assist you in drafting a new `SKILL.md`. The [`apm-package-author`](.github/skills/apm-package-author) skill can help you create or troubleshoot an `apm.yml` manifest if you want to package a skill for distribution.
