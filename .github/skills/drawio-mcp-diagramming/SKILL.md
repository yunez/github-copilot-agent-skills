# Draw.io MCP Diagramming Skill

Create or update diagrams via the Draw.io MCP server. Before generating XML, read [references/xml-authoring-rules.md](references/xml-authoring-rules.md) — hard constraints, container rules, and edge routing guidance that prevent the most common rendering failures. For layout anti-pattern fixes, see [references/layout-antipatterns.md](references/layout-antipatterns.md). For cloud topology conventions, icon libraries, and worked examples, see [references/azure.md](references/azure.md) and [references/aws.md](references/aws.md).

For diagrams that use only basic shapes (flowcharts, UML, ERD, org charts, mind maps, timelines, wireframes), skip icon discovery and proceed directly to `drawio/create_diagram` or `drawio/open_drawio_mermaid`.

## When to Use

- The user asks to create or refine architecture diagrams (Azure, AWS, multi-cloud, or generic).
- The user wants draw.io/diagrams.net output from an MCP workflow.
- The user asks for **Mermaid → draw.io** conversion.
- The user asks for **CSV → draw.io** conversion (org charts, flowcharts from tabular data).
- The user needs Azure service icons in diagrams.
- The user needs AWS service icons in diagrams.
- The user reports that Azure or AWS icons/shapes are not appearing.
- The user asks for an **auth or identity flow** (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, JWT validation, SSO, login, token exchange, Entra, Cognito).
- The user asks for an **API or microservice interaction diagram** (request/response chain, service-to-service calls, API gateway flow).
- The user asks for a **CI/CD pipeline or deployment workflow** (build, test, deploy stages, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, approval gates).
- The user wants to **edit an existing multi-page `.drawio` file** (Tool Server only).

## Required Tooling

Draw.io provides two MCP server variants. The skill works with either; call the tools that match the configured server.

### Option A — Hosted App Server (inline / "Open in draw.io" button)

- MCP tool: `drawio/create_diagram`
- Workspace MCP config:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "drawio": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.draw.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Supported inputs: `xml` (draw.io XML), `mermaid` (Mermaid.js text).
Optional layout passes: `postLayout: "elk"`, `routing: "libavoid"`.

### Option B — stdio Tool Server (opens draw.io in browser)

- MCP tools: `drawio/open_drawio_xml`, `drawio/open_drawio_mermaid`, `drawio/open_drawio_csv`, `drawio/search_shapes`, `drawio/list_pages`, `drawio/get_page`, `drawio/set_page`
- Workspace MCP config:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "drawio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@drawio/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Supported inputs: XML, Mermaid, CSV.
Optional layout pass: `routing: "libavoid"` on `open_drawio_xml` — **requires `@drawio/mcp` v1.3.0 or later**. On older versions the parameter is ignored, so pin with `npx -y @drawio/mcp@latest` if connector routing does not improve.

> Use **Option A** if your host supports MCP Apps inline rendering (Claude.ai, Cursor ≥ 2.6) or if the "Open in draw.io" button workflow is acceptable. Use **Option B** for VS Code / GitHub Copilot or any standard MCP client.

### Icon discovery tool (both servers)

- MCP tool: `drawio/search_shapes` — search 10,000+ draw.io shapes and return ready-to-use style strings.
- Parameters: `query` (space-separated keywords) and optional `limit` (default 10, max 50). Raise `limit` when a first search returns nothing usable, before concluding a shape does not exist.

### Tool name detection

MCP hosts may register tools with a server prefix (e.g. `mcp_drawio-mcp-ap_create_diagram` and `mcp_drawio-mcp-ap_search_shapes`). If `tool_search` does not surface the drawio tools, inspect the available or deferred tools list and call the exact names shown there. Do not assume a tool is unavailable if it appears in the deferred list; use the exact registered name.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot: run shape searches sequentially

In VS Code and GitHub Copilot, parallel tool calls are cancelled if the user sends a new message while they are in flight. Always run `drawio/search_shapes` calls **one at a time** — never in parallel batches.

### XML hard constraints, containers, and edge routing

The draw.io MCP server enforces strict XML rules, and the most common quality failures are flattened hierarchy and hand-routed edges. Before generating any XML, read [references/xml-authoring-rules.md](references/xml-authoring-rules.md) which covers:

- **Hard constraints** — forbidden constructs that cause the server to return a render error (XML comments, duplicate IDs, self-closing edge/geometry elements, unescaped characters)
- **Container rules** — nested `swimlane` containment, relative child coordinates, and why cross-container edges must sit at `parent="1"`
- **Edge routing** — let `routing: "libavoid"` or `postLayout: "elk"` compute paths; the narrow cases where manual connection points are justified
- **Pre-generation edge checklist** — run before writing edge XML for any infrastructure diagram

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Identify the input format and diagram type**
   - For flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERD, mind maps, Gantt, timelines, kanban: prefer **Mermaid** if the Tool Server is available, or use the App Server's `mermaid` parameter.
   - For org charts or flowcharts from tabular data: use **CSV** with the Tool Server (`drawio/open_drawio_csv`).
   - For diagrams with named services, vendor shapes, or pictorial icons: use **XML** (`drawio/create_diagram` or `drawio/open_drawio_xml`).

2. **Use `drawio/search_shapes` for any non-geometric shape** — it searches all 10,000+ shapes across every draw.io library and returns ready-to-use style strings.
   - Use it for cloud services (Azure, AWS, GCP), network equipment (Cisco, Juniper), container/orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Docker), brand logos (Slack, GitHub), IT infrastructure shapes, and any other named component.
   - Example queries: `"azure virtual machine"`, `"aws lambda"`, `"cisco router"`, `"kubernetes pod"`, `"slack"`, `"docker"`.
   - Use the returned style string directly in the XML cell — do not guess or fabricate style strings.
   - Skip `search_shapes` only for diagrams that use purely geometric shapes: rectangles, diamonds, circles, and arrows.

3. **When to use `search_shapes` vs skip it** — if a shape has a recognised name, brand, or product identity, always look it up via `search_shapes` first. Only skip it for standard geometric diagrams (flowcharts, UML, ERD, org charts, mind maps, timelines, wireframes) that need no pictorial icons. For sequence and flow diagrams, apply Sequence and Flow Diagram Patterns (see section below).

4. **Nest groupings with real containers, not stacked rectangles** — for any diagram with hierarchy (VNet → Subnet → resource, VPC → AZ → instance, Region → Environment → Service, swimlanes), make each level a `swimlane;startSize=24;` container, set `parent="<container_id>"` on children, and give children coordinates **relative to their parent**. Edges between cells in *different* containers must use `parent="1"` or they render inside the container and get clipped. Drawing a large rectangle and positioning shapes on top of it at absolute coordinates is the anti-pattern the draw.io XML reference explicitly calls out — it breaks move/resize, collapse, and layout passes.

5. **Keep labels unique and sparse** — if several edges say the same thing, collapse them into one labelled flow or a single note box. Do not repeat the same wording in the title, legend, lane name, and callout; each text element should have one job.

6. **For cloud infrastructure diagrams, load the vendor reference** — read [references/azure.md](references/azure.md) for anything with VNets, subnets, or Azure icons, and [references/aws.md](references/aws.md) for anything with VPCs, AZs, or AWS icons. Read both for multi-cloud diagrams. Each covers that vendor's icon library and caveats, container structure, colour palette, annotation boxes, a complete worked example, and a topology checklist.

7. **Build the payload**
   - XML: valid `mxGraphModel` using verified icons/style strings.
   - Mermaid: valid Mermaid.js definition (App Server: pass as `mermaid`; Tool Server: use `drawio/open_drawio_mermaid`).
   - CSV: valid CSV content (Tool Server: use `drawio/open_drawio_csv`).

8. **Call the appropriate tool**
   - App Server: `drawio/create_diagram` with `xml` or `mermaid`.
   - Tool Server: `drawio/open_drawio_xml`, `drawio/open_drawio_mermaid`, or `drawio/open_drawio_csv`.

9. **Decide the layout pass before writing XML, then let it route the edges**
   - `routing: "libavoid"` — keeps your hand-placed coordinates and only reroutes connectors around shapes. This is the default for topology, architecture, deployment, and container-based diagrams.
   - `postLayout: "elk"` — full re-layout that replaces your vertex positions. Use for directional/hierarchical XML (pipelines, decision flows). Add `direction: "horizontal"` when the flow reads left-to-right — it defaults to `vertical`, which is why left-to-right CI/CD pipelines come out stacked.
   - Do **not** combine `postLayout` and `routing` — ELK already routes its own edges. `direction` is XML-only and ignored for Mermaid (Mermaid takes direction from `flowchart TD/LR`).
   - Do **not** hand-write `exitX`/`entryX` or `<Array as="points">` waypoints. The routing pass computes them, and manual values fight it. See [references/xml-authoring-rules.md](references/xml-authoring-rules.md) for the narrow exceptions.

10. If the user wants a file artifact, save as `.drawio` wrapped in `<mxfile><diagram>...</diagram></mxfile>`. **Read [references/standalone-file-requirements.md](references/standalone-file-requirements.md) before writing any `.drawio` file by hand** (or whenever the MCP tools are unavailable) — the MCP tools add `as="geometry"` and the `mxGraphModel` layout attributes for you, and without them every element collapses to the origin.

11. Keep labels concise and explicit (service name + role).

12. Prefer one icon per major component or service; use edges for flow semantics (ingress/egress/dependency/telemetry).

## Input Format Quick Reference

Choose the input that matches the diagram type and configured server.

| Input | Best for | App Server | Tool Server |
|---|---|---|---|
| **XML** | Architecture/topology diagrams with vendor or pictorial icons, custom layouts | `drawio/create_diagram` with `xml` | `drawio/open_drawio_xml` |
| **Mermaid** | Flowcharts, sequence, class, ER, state, mindmap, Gantt, timeline, kanban | `drawio/create_diagram` with `mermaid` | `drawio/open_drawio_mermaid` |
| **CSV** | Org charts, flowcharts, simple diagrams from tabular data | Not supported | `drawio/open_drawio_csv` |

Use Mermaid for standard diagram types; use XML when the user needs pictorial or vendor-specific icons, precise positioning, complex containers, or custom styling. See [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for Mermaid/CSV examples and multi-page editing details.

## Visual Quality Guardrails

Apply these defaults unless the user explicitly asks for a dense/technical view:

- Use 3-4 major lanes/zones max (for example Source → Process → Destination).
- Keep primary flow left-to-right with a single main path.
- Use stage numbering (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) instead of many edge labels.
- Keep one icon per major component; avoid icon-per-step layouts.
- Limit cross-lane dashed lines to one security/auth line and one optional telemetry line.
- **Edge density**: for nodes with 3+ outgoing edges, reduce duplicates first (for example one gateway → one aggregated backend edge). Then let `routing: "libavoid"` separate what remains — only add explicit `exitX`/`exitY` if a specific edge is still ambiguous after routing.
- Keep text concise (single purpose per box) and avoid multiline overload.
- Keep edge labels short and unique; if adjacent edges repeat the same protocol/port wording, collapse them or move the shared detail to one annotation box.
- Avoid repeating the same label in the title, legend, lane name, and callout.
- **Animated flow on connectors**: adding `flowAnimation=1;` to any edge style renders a moving dot that travels along the arrow, making directional flow immediately visible without extra labels — ideal for data-flow and pipeline diagrams. The animation is preserved in SVG export and the draw.io desktop app. By default, ask the user whether they want any flow arrows animated before generating the diagram — *"Would you like any of the flow arrows animated to show traffic direction? If so, which ones?"* Apply `flowAnimation=1;` only to the edges the user identifies. If the user has already indicated they want a static/clean diagram, skip the question.
- Prefer a "clean" variant first; add detail only if requested.

For worked examples of common layout problems (stacked edges, repeated labels, observability inside VNet, etc.), see [references/layout-antipatterns.md](references/layout-antipatterns.md).

## Cloud Infrastructure Topology (Azure and AWS)

Vendor-specific topology guidance lives in per-cloud reference files. Load the one that matches the diagram — or both for multi-cloud:

- **Azure** — [references/azure.md](references/azure.md): read for any diagram with VNets, subnets, or Azure icons. Covers the azure2 and mscae icon libraries and their caveats, nested VNet → subnet container structure, colour and border conventions, traffic palette, annotation boxes, a complete worked example, and the Azure topology checklist.
- **AWS** — [references/aws.md](references/aws.md): read for any diagram with VPCs, AZs, or AWS icons. Covers the AWS4 stencil library and its caveats, nested VPC → AZ → subnet container structure, subnet-tier colour coding, NAT/IGW egress paths, security group annotation, a complete worked example, and the AWS topology checklist.

Shared rules that apply to both — containment, edge routing, and hard XML constraints — stay in [references/xml-authoring-rules.md](references/xml-authoring-rules.md).


## Sequence and Flow Diagram Patterns

Use this section for diagrams that show **temporal flows** — what happens in order — rather than infrastructure topology. No shape lookup via `drawio/search_shapes` is required.

### When to Apply

| Diagram type | Keywords | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| Auth / authorisation flow | OAuth, OIDC, JWT, SSO, login, token exchange, Entra, Cognito | Swimlane interaction flow |
| API / microservice call chain | REST, GraphQL, request/response, service-to-service, API gateway | Swimlane or vertical flowchart |
| CI/CD pipeline | pipeline, build, deploy, release, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, approval gate | Horizontal pipeline flowchart |

### Layout Approach

**Swimlane interaction flow** (auth / API flows with 2–5 actors):
- Use flat `swimlane` lanes stacked vertically at `parent="1"`, one actor per lane: `swimlane;horizontal=0;startSize=110;fillColor=<pastel>;html=1;` with geometry `x=0, y=lane_index*150, width=CANVAS_W, height=150`
- Step boxes are children of their lane (`parent="<lane_id>"`) with coordinates relative to the lane: `x = 120 + col*180`, `y = 45`, size `140x60` (`140x80` for decision diamonds). The `x=120` start clears the 110px title area
- Number steps (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) in the label so execution order is unambiguous
- Cross-lane edges must sit at `parent="1"`, not inside a lane, or they are clipped
- Use `edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;` and let the routing pass place the bends
- Canvas width: `max_col * 180 + 300`; do not nest lanes inside a pool or vary lane heights
- Canvas height: `actor_count * 150 + 100`

**Horizontal pipeline flowchart** (CI/CD):
- Stages flow left-to-right: Source → Build → Test → Staging → Approval → Production
- Use `rounded=1` rectangles for stages, `rhombus` shape for gate / decision points
- Colour-code each stage box using the Stage Colours table below
- Failure branch goes downward from the gate with a red edge to a Rollback/Notify step
- Pass `postLayout: "elk"` with `direction: "horizontal"` — without `direction` the default vertical pass stacks the pipeline top-to-bottom
- Canvas: `pageWidth="1700" pageHeight="600"`

### Colour Conventions

**Edge colours** (consistent with topology palette):

| Meaning | `strokeColor` | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Primary request / call | `#0078D4` Azure blue | solid, `strokeWidth=2` |
| Success response / return | `#00897B` Teal | solid, `strokeWidth=2` |
| Token / credential / redirect | `#F57C00` Amber | `dashed=1`, `strokeWidth=2` |
| Async / event-driven call | `#5C6BC0` Indigo | `dashed=1`, `strokeWidth=2` |
| Error / rejection / rollback | `#C62828` Red | solid, `strokeWidth=2` |
| Optional / conditional | `#666666` Grey | `dashed=1`, `strokeWidth=1` |

**Participant lane colours** (swimlane header + column background at `opacity=30`):

| Actor type | `fillColor` | `strokeColor` |
|---|---|---|
| User / browser / client | `#dae8fc` | `#6c8ebf` |
| Identity provider (Entra, Cognito, Okta) | `#e6f4ea` | `#82b366` |
| API / backend service | `#fff3e0` | `#e6821e` |
| Database / data store | `#f5f5f5` | `#666666` |
| Managed service / external system | `#f3e5f5` | `#7B1FA2` |

**Stage fill colours** (CI/CD pipeline):

| Stage | `fillColor` | `fontColor` |
|---|---|---|
| Source / Trigger | `#0078D4` | `#ffffff` |
| Build | `#00897B` | `#ffffff` |
| Test / Quality Gate | `#F57C00` | `#ffffff` |
| Deploy to Staging | `#5C6BC0` | `#ffffff` |
| Approval Gate | `#795548` | `#ffffff` |
| Deploy to Production | `#43A047` | `#ffffff` |
| Rollback / Failure | `#C62828` | `#ffffff` |

### Flow Animation

`flowAnimation=1;` works on sequence/flow edges exactly as in topology diagrams. Apply to primary call paths or pipeline stage transitions. Always ask the user before applying.

### Checklist (Sequence/Flow Diagrams)

- [ ] Diagram type identified (auth flow / API flow / CI/CD pipeline)
- [ ] Actors / participants labelled clearly
- [ ] Steps numbered in execution order
- [ ] Edge colours consistent with conventions above
- [ ] Error / failure paths shown in red
- [ ] Animation preference confirmed with user before generating
- [ ] Canvas sized appropriately for participant count and step depth

## Icon Discovery: Hard Gate and Fallback

This applies to all shapes — cloud services, network equipment, brand logos, and any pictorial icon.

1. **`drawio/search_shapes` is the only accepted source** — do not guess or fabricate style strings.
2. If a style string cannot be confirmed, find an alternative via `drawio/search_shapes` before generating.
3. If a shape renders incorrectly, use `drawio/search_shapes` for an alternative, substitute, and regenerate.

## How to Discover Shapes

`drawio/search_shapes` searches all 10,000+ shapes across every draw.io library and returns ready-to-use style strings. Use it for **any** shape that has a name, brand, or product identity — not just cloud providers.

Example queries by category:

| Category | Example queries |
|---|---|
| Azure | `"azure virtual machine"`, `"azure key vault"`, `"azure api management"` |
| AWS | `"aws lambda"`, `"aws s3"`, `"aws ec2"` |
| GCP | `"gcp compute engine"`, `"gcp cloud storage"` |
| Network equipment | `"cisco router"`, `"cisco firewall"`, `"juniper switch"` |
| Containers / orchestration | `"kubernetes pod"`, `"docker"`, `"helm"` |
| Brands / SaaS | `"slack"`, `"github"`, `"jira"`, `"salesforce"` |
| On-premises / IT | `"server"`, `"database"`, `"laptop"`, `"printer"` |

Always use the returned `style` value directly on the `mxCell` — never guess or fabricate a style string.

The style format varies by library:

```text
# Image-based (Azure azure2, SVG files)
image;aspect=fixed;html=1;points=[];align=center;image=img/lib/azure2/<category>/<Name>.svg;

# Stencil-based (AWS4, shape library)
shape=mxgraph.aws4.<name>;fillColor=<color>;fontColor=#ffffff;strokeColor=none;

# Stencil-based (Cisco, Kubernetes, etc.)
shape=mxgraph.cisco.<category>.<name>;sketch=0;html=1;

# Icon-service (brand logos and concept icons, returned as an absolute URL)
shape=image;html=1;verticalLabelPosition=bottom;verticalAlign=top;image=https://<icon-service-host>/<icon>.svg;
```

When the built-in libraries have no strong match, `search_shapes` supplements results from the draw.io icon service (the same grouped icon search the editor sidebar uses) and returns them as `shape=image` styles with an absolute URL. These are valid results — use them as returned rather than rejecting them for not matching an `img/lib/...` path.

## Fallback Strategy if Shapes Still Fail

If any shapes do not render correctly:

- Do **not** generate the diagram with an unresolved shape style.
- Use `drawio/search_shapes` to find alternative verified style strings.
- Return the list of unresolved shapes and propose verified replacements.
- After replacements validate to `OK`, then generate the diagram.

## Exporting Diagrams

| Format | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **SVG** | `File → Export As → SVG` | Recommended — preserves `flowAnimation` moving-dot effects and all icon rendering. Use for sharing or embedding. |
| **PNG** | `File → Export As → PNG` | Static snapshot. `flowAnimation` effects are not captured; icons and colours are preserved. |
| **PDF** | `File → Export As → PDF` | Best for printed or document-embedded diagrams. Static only. |
| **.drawio file** | `File → Save As` | Preserves all XML, animation settings, and style attributes for future editing. |

> `flowAnimation=1` is only visible when the diagram is open in **draw.io desktop** or rendered as **SVG**. It does not appear in PNG or PDF exports — inform the user of this if they ask why the animation isn't showing.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- Confirm the configured MCP server appears in `MCP: List Servers`.
- Run `MCP: Reset Cached Tools` if tool list is stale.
- **XML comments (`<!-- -->`) are forbidden** — the MCP server rejects them. Remove all comments before submitting.
- Ensure XML is otherwise well-formed (no malformed tags, no duplicate IDs, no unescaped `<`/`>`/`&` in style strings).
- **Z-order**: when shapes are siblings at `parent="1"`, background rectangles must be defined **before** the icons they sit behind, or they render on top. Using real containers (`swimlane`, `container=1`) avoids the problem entirely — children always render above their parent.
- **`html=1` in style** is required for any cell whose `value` contains HTML tags (`<b>`, `<br>`, `<i>`). Newlines via `&#xa;` work without it.
- **`sketch=0` in search results**: if `drawio/search_shapes` returns a style string containing `sketch=0`, preserve it exactly — omitting it enables the hand-drawn sketch rendering mode for that shape.
- **Icon sizes**: use dimensions as returned by `search_shapes`; they reflect the intended aspect ratio. When normalising a row of icons for visual consistency, 64×64 is a safe common size. Never change the aspect ratio of an icon that has `aspect=fixed` in its style.
- **Azure / AWS icon rendering**: vendor-specific style rules and fixes are in [references/azure.md](references/azure.md) and [references/aws.md](references/aws.md).
- Reopen diagram in web draw.io if VS Code extension rendering differs.
- If an icon looks wrong, use `drawio/search_shapes` for an alternative exact style string.

## Prompt Templates and Checklists

See [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for diagram-type prompt presets and [references/layout-antipatterns.md](references/layout-antipatterns.md) for the pre-flight layout checklist.

## Definition of Done

- The correct input format and MCP tool were chosen (XML, Mermaid, or CSV; App Server or Tool Server).
- All icon/style strings confirmed via `drawio/search_shapes` before generating; unconfirmed icons are not used.
- Diagram renders correctly; XML/Mermaid/CSV is valid and opens in draw.io.
- All named components identifiable via correct icons and clear labels.
- Layout pass chosen deliberately (`routing: "libavoid"` for hand-placed/container layouts; `postLayout: "elk"` — with `direction: "horizontal"` for left-to-right flows — for directional diagrams; never both).
- All applicable topology checklist items passed (borders, subnets, traffic labels, legend, isolation box, zones, canvas size).
- All applicable sequence/flow checklist items passed (numbered steps, colour-coded edges, error paths, canvas size).
- Animation preference confirmed; `flowAnimation=1;` applied only to user-identified edges.
- Nested groupings use real containers: each level a `swimlane`, children parented to their container with relative coordinates, cross-container edges at `parent="1"`.
- File artifact saved as `.drawio` (wrapped in `<mxfile>`) if requested, following [references/standalone-file-requirements.md](references/standalone-file-requirements.md).
- Edges declare only `source`/`target`: no hand-written `<Array as="points">` waypoints or `exitX`/`entryX` overrides unless a documented exception applies. See [references/xml-authoring-rules.md](references/xml-authoring-rules.md).
- Layout anti-patterns checked against [references/layout-antipatterns.md](references/layout-antipatterns.md) before finalising.
